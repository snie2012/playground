Title: Modeling a Building

Description:
In this Blender 2.5 video tutorial we go through a fun modeling exercise by modeling a building from a single reference. Due to not have any head-on views of the building we model everything by eyeballing it, using some techniques to best approximate the actual dimensions. By the end of the tutorial we're left with a model that could easily be used as a game asset or as a base for much more highly detailed building model. 

The reference is kindly provided by our very own Wes Burke.
